> **Tagline:** “Talk to your wallet. Talk to your chain. Talk to your world.”

## The Vision

Web3 today is powerful, but overwhelming. New users struggle with onboarding, wallets, gas fees, and dApps.
**OGe** is a **personal AI-powered companion** that bridges this gap, helping anyone navigate decentralized ecosystems seamlessly. Unlike centralized assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant), OGe is:

* User-owned: Data never leaves the user’s control.
* Decentralized: Powered by OG’s compute and storage.
* Composable: Can be integrated into dApps, wallets, and enterprise solutions.

Our goal is to redefine digital assistance — privacy-first, transparent, and unstoppable.

Imagine:

* Asking *“Send 5 USDC to Alex”* and OGe executes it.
* Saying *“Explain this NFT project in simple words”* and OGe teaches you.
* Requesting *“Summarize my last 5 transactions”* and OGe responds instantly.

**OGe is not just a chatbot. It’s your AI-native, wallet-aware, and gasless Web3 guide.**
